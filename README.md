coin
====
coin is a command interpreter for Unix.
It is a static binary under 3 KB (2829 bytes).

It can be used as a basic interactive shell, and can read scripts
containing command executions, but has no scripting language
support.

It is for learning about how commands are issued from the shell.

Building
--------
Just run `make`.
This will probably only run on
[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)/amd64
as is.
Feel free to port to your Unix of choice.
